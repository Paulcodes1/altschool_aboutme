    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Paul Ofili, a passionate and resilient individual with a deep interest in technology and innovation. I am a graduate of Computer Science from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, where I developed the foundational knowledge that would later shape my path into the world of software development. I am currently undergoing my National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), a phase that has also given me the space to reflect on and focus more intently on building my tech career.

      My journey into tech hasn’t been linear or easy. I initially started learning Python, with the hopes of becoming a backend developer. Later, I developed a strong interest in Data Science due to my love for data, analytics, and problem-solving. However, these ambitions were greatly challenged by one major limitation — I didn’t have a personal laptop at the time. This made practicing and growing consistently in either field nearly impossible.

      In my 300-level Industrial Training (IT), I had hoped to gain hands-on experience in backend or data science roles, but couldn't find suitable opportunities. Instead, I got placed in a Frontend Development role — and honestly, that’s where everything changed. I found myself enjoying the visual side of development — the ability to see changes in real-time and build interactive user interfaces from scratch was incredibly fulfilling. That experience was a huge turning point.

      Even after my IT, I continued to learn frontend on my own, using free online resources, documentation, and video tutorials. But without a proper structure or community to guide me, my learning was inconsistent, and progress was often slow and scattered. I knew I needed more than just motivation — I needed a clear path, mentorship, and accountability.

      One of the highlights of my academic journey was my final year project, where I designed and developed a Speech-to-Text system for classroom lectures using Python. This project aimed to help students transcribe spoken lectures into text in real-time — a solution that bridges accessibility gaps and enhances learning for all types of students. It was an exciting blend of my Python skills and passion for building useful, real-world solutions, and it further reinforced my desire to master both Frontend Development and Data Science in the future.

      Outside of my tech journey, I’m a curious and creative person. I enjoy watching movies, which often helps me relax and sometimes even inspires design ideas. I’ve also recently picked up a love for cooking — experimenting with new recipes has become both a hobby and a form of stress relief. Occasionally, I read books, especially those that challenge the way I think and help me grow mentally and emotionally.

      I would describe myself as someone who is adaptable, self-driven, and constantly learning. Even when I lacked the tools, I never gave up — I kept learning, kept exploring, and kept believing in my potential. My journey has been shaped by persistence, and every setback has only fueled my desire to grow stronger and better.

    <h3>Why I joined AltSchool</h3>
    <p>
      My journey into tech has always been filled with self-discovery, but also challenges — particularly a lack of direction and structure. I had been teaching myself frontend development for quite some time, but the learning was random, unstructured, and sometimes overwhelming. I often felt stuck, unsure whether I was making real progress or just going in circles.

      I came across AltSchool Africa on X (formerly Twitter), and it immediately caught my attention. It sounded like the exact kind of community and structure I had been looking for. However, what made the experience real was when I received an unexpected email telling me that I had been selected for a scholarship sponsored by Bybit. I accepted it without hesitation. It felt like a sign — a door finally opening at the right time.

      What excited me the most about AltSchool was the well-organized curriculum, the practical, hands-on projects, and the clear pathway to growth. It promised what I lacked for years: structure, accountability, mentorship, and a sense of community. Knowing that I would be learning alongside others, with guidance and goals, made me feel like I could finally grow with purpose and clarity.

      Joining AltSchool wasn’t just about learning how to code better. It was about becoming a more disciplined, more focused, and more confident version of myself. It was the beginning of a new chapter — one where I could finally connect the dots and push myself toward becoming the developer I always wanted to be.

    <h3>My Goals for the School of Engineering Program</h3>
    <p>
      I joined the School of Engineering program with the determination to not only become a better frontend developer, but to elevate my skills to a world-class level. I don’t want to just build websites — I want to build products that matter, products that solve real problems and improve lives.

      One of my biggest goals is to gain the ability to bring any idea to life — from the user interface to how it works under the hood. I want to master the tools, languages, and best practices that define modern frontend development, especially in areas like React, performance optimization, state management, and accessibility.

      But beyond technical skills, I want to develop as a problem-solver, collaborator, and creative thinker. I aim to build a strong portfolio of real-world projects, participate in open-source contributions, and prepare myself to thrive in any professional setting.

      Long-term, my ambition is to blend my frontend expertise with my interest in Data Science, creating intelligent and data-driven user experiences. I believe there's so much potential in combining the visual power of the frontend with the analytical depth of data — and I want to live in that intersection.

      I also have a heart for community and mentorship. I want to help others — especially those who, like me, once felt stuck or lacked resources — to find their path, grow, and build amazing things. I see AltSchool not just as a school, but as a launchpad for a career of impact, innovation, and leadership.
